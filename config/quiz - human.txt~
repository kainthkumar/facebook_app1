Inflation is the rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy, commonly referred to as the “cost of living”, over a period of time.

They’re called “mutual funds” because a large number of investors purchase shares in the fund, thus becoming mutual owners of the fund and its investments.  How then does one purchase and sell a share of a mutual fund?",

                           "explanation":"There are two basic types of mutual funds – <b>open-end</b> and <b>closed-end funds</b>.  Open-end funds do not have a limit as to how many shares they can issue.  You purchase shares directly from the fund, which creates new shares to meet your demand.  Open-end funds often require investors to meet an investment minimum in order to participate in the fund.  Because open-end funds do not trade on the public markets like individual stocks, you won’t see them in the Market.  However, you will see closed-end funds, which like individual stocks, have a set number of shares and are publicly traded."

Small cap companies tend to outperform the market during expansion phases and are less likely to pay dividends (need the cash to grow the business).
